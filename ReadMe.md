# Free Discord Bot

If you're too lazy or don't know how to properly program a Discord bot in ***JavaScript***, here's how to do it:

Before we start, make sure you have your bot's token. If not, go to [Discord's developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Step #1

Download and install node.js

## Step #2

Download and install Visual Studio Code or any code editor

## Step #3

Open up Visual Studio Code and create a new file

## Step #4

Open up your terminal and clone this repository by typing in the terminal `git clone https://github.com/tkrpe/free-discordjs-bot.git`

## Step #5

Type in the terminal `cd free-discordjs-bot`

## Step #6

Type in the following into the terminal:
`npm init -y`
`npm install discord.js`

## Step #7

Run your Discord bot by typing in `node .`

And there you have it!
Don't ask why I made this.
If you're still confused and need help, watch some tutorials.

*Have fun!*
